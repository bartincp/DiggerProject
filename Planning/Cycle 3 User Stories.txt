The user will see, in addtion to dirt, enemies, and emeralds, bags of gold scattered across the map upon map generation.
Any entity will not be able to push the bag of money into dirt in order to dig it.
However, the user and the hobbins will be able to move the bags of money into empty space.
If vertical space(s) exist below the empty space that the bag is pushed into, it will proceed to fall.
Any living entity that collides with the falling bag of money will die.
After falling at least three spaces, the bag of money will explode, transforming into a pile of money.
The user or Hobbins can pick up these piles of money for an increase in points.
Additionally, Hobbins and Nobbins will be able to respawn a few seconds after dying.
