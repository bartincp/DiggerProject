The user will intially see nobbins spawning near the other end of the playing space.
The nobbins will attempt to navigate through preexisting tunnels towards the player.
The nobbins will also attempt not to cross with other nobbins.
Over time, the nobblins will eventually transform into hobbins.
All hobbins will be able to dig their own tunnels and attempt to destroy collectables and the player.
If the player enters the same space or comes in contact with an enemy, he will die and respawn with one less life.
If the player presses space, a projectile will radiate from the player's facing direction in a straight line.
If the projectile hits an enemy, the enemy will die and disapper.
