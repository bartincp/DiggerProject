Hobbin/Nobbin creation
Est. time: 1 hour
Actual time: 1 hour
Comment: It was fairly simple to create constructors for both enemy classes, and to assign icons and properties to said enemies. Hobbins simply became extended classes of Nobbins

Nobbin movement, transformation, and Hobbin movement
Est. time: 2.5 hours
Actual time: 3+ hours
Comment: Developing the movement and transformation "AI" behavior was significantly more challenging than creating classes for the enemies. The challenge was made harder by the behavior requested for the Hobbins.

Laser generation on space key and laser travel/killing
Est. time: 1 hour
Actual time: 2 hours
Comment: Making a traveling entity that killed enemy entities was a bit harder than expected, but some functionality was reached and it does indeed travel across the map. The ability to kill has yet to be verified.

Ability for player to die and respawn
Est. time: 1 hour
Actual time: 1 hour
Comment: It was fairly straightforward to add functionality to the player so that, after colliding with the enemy, he respawns and has one less life remaining.
